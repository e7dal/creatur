Créatúr
=======

Créatúr is a software framework for automating experiments
with artificial life (ALife) or other evolutionary algorithms (EA). 
It provides a daemon which ensures that each agent gets its turn 
to use the CPU. 
You can use other applications on the computer at the same time
without fear of interfering with experiments; they
will run normally (although perhaps more slowly).
Créatúr also provides a library of modules to help you implement your own 
ALife species.
Even if you aren't using the Créatúr framework, you may find some of these
modules useful.

A tutorial on how to use Créatúr, including lots of examples,
is available at https://github.com/mhwombat/creatur-examples/raw/master/Tutorial.pdf.

Créatúr (pronounced kray-toor) is an irish word 
meaning animal, creature, or unfortunate person.
