# description:
#     A software framework for automating experiments
#     with artificial life. It provides a daemon which
#     maintains its own "clock", schedules events,
#     provides logging, and ensures that each agent gets
#     its turn to use the CPU. You can use other
#     applications on the computer at the same time
#     without fear of interfering with experiments; they
#     will run normally, just more slowly. See the
#     tutorial at
#     <https://github.com/mhwombat/creatur-examples/raw/master/Tutorial.pdf>
#     for examples on how to use the
#     Créatúr framework.
#     .
#     About the name: \"Créatúr\" (pronounced kray-toor)
#     is an Irish word meaning animal, creature, or an
#     unfortunate person.
