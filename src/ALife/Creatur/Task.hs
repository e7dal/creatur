-- It’s also easy to write your own tasks, using these as a guide.)

--   The input parameter is a list of agents. The first agent in the
--   list is the agent whose turn it is to use the CPU. The rest of
--   the list contains agents it could interact with. For example, if
--   agents reproduce sexually, the program might check if the first
--   agent in the list is female, and the second one is male, and if so,
--   mate them to produce offspring. The input list is generated in a
--   way that guarantees that every possible sequence of agents has an
--   equal chance of occurring.
